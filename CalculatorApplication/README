Important: Application Setup Instructions
---------------------------------------------

The complete application files were too large to upload as a single folder, so they've been split into 4
separate folders in this repository. You must combine these folders before running the application.

Setup Steps:
Download all folders from this repository (Folder1, Folder2, Folder3, and Folder4)

Merge the folders:

Create a new empty folder on your computer (e.g., "Calculator-Complete")
Copy all contents from all 4 folders into this new folder
Make sure to preserve the folder structure when copying
If asked to replace files, select "Replace" (the files should be identical)


Run the application:

The executable application is located in Folder1
After merging all folders, navigate to this folder and run the application file (CalculatorApp.exe or similar)
